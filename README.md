# Visualizing Wisconsin's Efficiency Gap
visualize_wi_efficiency_gap

The case Gill v.  Whitford is about whether Wisconsin's state legislative districts should be struck down due to extreme partisan gerrymandering.
Key to the case is the how partisan gerrymandering is being measured, the *efficiency gap*.
While reading about the efficiency gap, here [https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/whitford-v-gill](https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/whitford-v-gill), and elsewhere, I noticed that there were no maps showing what this looks like across the state, and so I have made an effort to display what it looks like for the Assembly districts in the 2016 elections. 

Perhaps there is a reason there are no maps like these for a reason, and if you know one, please let me know.
